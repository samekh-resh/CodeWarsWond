// Write a function, gooseFilter / goose-filter / goose_filter / GooseFilter, that takes an array of strings as an argument and returns a filtered array containing the same elements but with the 'geese' removed.

// The geese are any strings in the following array, which is pre-populated in your solution:

// geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"]
// For example, if this array were passed as an argument:

// ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "African", "Crested", "Pilgrim", "Toulouse", "Blue Swedish"]
// Your function would return the following array:

// ["Mallard", "Hook Bill", "Crested", "Blue Swedish"]
// The elements in the returned array should be in the same order as in the initial array passed to your function, albeit with the 'geese' removed. Note that all of the strings will be in the same case as those provided, and some elements may be repeated.

function gooseFilter (birds) {
    var geese = ["African", "Roman Tufted", "Toulouse", "Pilgrim", "Steinbacher"];
    
    return birds.filter(bird => !geese.includes(bird))
    // return an array containing all of the strings in the input array except those that match strings in geese
  };
  
  
  //what we're saying here is that if the bird array does NOT include what is in the geese array, we do not want it to print. 
  //so what we need to do is use a filter, because the filter is basically going to filter through
